 jaddari_mounted_legionaries_title:0 "Mounted Legionaries"
 jaddari_mounted_legionaries_desc:0 "Since the return of the Phoenix Legions to Bulwar and their eventual settlement in the far Salahad, our armies have gone through many developments. Our new method of mounted combat and hit and run tactics has proven very effective. We should double down on it and transform our armies to be fully mounted."
 jaddari_deal_with_the_xhazobkult_title:0 "Deal with the Xhazobkult"
 jaddari_deal_with_the_xhazobkult_desc:0 "The duties of Surael are our own. And one of the greatest duties is that of fighting the darkness. There is no greater darkness than the demonic worship of the Xhazobkult. We must destroy it and break its power over the gnoll."
 jaddari_enlighten_the_gnoll_title:0 "Enlighten the Gnolls"
 jaddari_enlighten_the_gnoll_desc:0 "The gnolls close to our home have been brought into the light. However there are still many that live in Bulwar that follow the Xhazobkult. A great start has been made, but let us spread the truth to all gnolls, that they might truly be enlightened."
 jaddari_the_western_harpies_title:0 "The Western Harpies"
 jaddari_the_western_harpies_desc:0 "While the Saidunan harpies in the east have found themselves sociable and capable of reasonable dealings, the harpies in the west are found to be more difficult to deal with.

 jaddari_birsantanses_kneels_desc:0 "The Harpy Hills are an area that is exceedingly difficult to control. And while they are our enemy, Birsartanšes has historically done a good job of managing the rough terrain. Let us subjugate them that we can make use of their experience."

 jaddari_up_to_ovdal_tungr_desc:0 "Bahar is the great access to Cannor, and the great gate of Bahar is the hold of the Copper Dwarves. But since the Decades of Devastation the region is a mess. We must bring order and light to this chaotic region. Dwarf, human, elf and goblin will live in harmony under the sun of Surael, and under our rule."
 jaddari_the_subjugation_of_reuyel_title:0 "The Subjugation of Re'uyel"
 jaddari_the_subjugation_of_reuyel_desc:0 "The Republic of Re'uyel was the of those under the sway of the Sun Elves to throw off their shackles and stand up to their lies. We have since greatly admitted their conviction and we must integrate that spirit into our realm. We need those who see clearly to spread the light of Surael."
 jaddari_the_ports_of_businor_title:0 "The Ports of Businor"
 jaddari_the_ports_of_businor_desc:0 "The Divenhal is a great sea and we have found our navies and shipyards sadly lacking. If we manage to seize the ports of Businor we will be able to ensure total control over our portion of the sea and build up a navy so that no one can contest it."

 jaddari_summon_the_legionaries_title:0 "Summon the Legionaries"
 jaddari_summon_the_legionaries_desc:0 "It is time to start the great campaign. The Sun Elves in Bulwar have not fulfilled their duties to Surael and they have let the Xhazobkult rule too large an area. It is time someone more capable took over. Let us summon our armies and take this fate into our own hands."
 jaddari_seize_azka_sur_title:0 "Seize Azka-Sur"
 jaddari_seize_azka_sur_desc:0 "Azka-Sur, the fortress of the sun, is the furthest eastwards bastion of the Cult. It will serve as an example of our dominance over the Cult and the starting point for the spread of our faith. Its fertile lands can also make for a good base to build our empire upon."
 jaddari_upper_suran_plain_title:0 "The Upper Suran Plain"
 jaddari_upper_suran_plain_desc:0 "The Suran is the most important river of Bulwar. By capturing the upper plains we can start to reap the benefits of cultivatable land.

 jaddari_the_heart_of_bulwar_title:0 "The Heart of Bulwar"
 jaddari_the_heart_of_bulwar_desc:0 "The entire region is named after this single city: Bulwar. While it has seen greater days and has now been overtaken by Brasan as the most important city.

With Brasan we have total dominance over the lifeblood of Bulwar. We will hold the Suran from the source to the sea and we will be the undisputed dominant power of Bulwar."
 jaddari_the_salahad_gate_title:0 "The Salahad Gate"
 jaddari_the_salahad_gate_desc:0 "Bulwar is a fortress for one who holds all of it. The Serpentspine guards its norther front and the Salahad its south and east. To the west is the Divenhal sea. There gates narrow passes and caravan paths that lead out and in. Holding those will allow total control of the entry and exit into and out of Bulwar. We need to seize the Salahad Gate to fully secure that flank."

 jaddari_light_for_kheterata_desc:0 "Kheterata is surrounded by the Xhazobkult on all sides. It is a darkness that constantly threatens to overwhelm them. Sadly they do not have the light of the Sun to guide them. Let us bring them into the Jadd that they might form a bastion against the darkness."

 jaddari_build_a_grand_temple_title:0 "Build a Grand Temple"
 jaddari_build_a_grand_temple_desc:0 "Other religions have great temples. It is time to claim our position and to show the world that we aren't some passing heresy. Azka-Sur will come to house the greatest monument of the Jadd. The temple's steeples will glitter gold and its domes and halls will leave no one to doubt that we are the only true faith."
 jaddari_spread_the_faith_title:0 "Spread the faith"
 jaddari_spread_the_faith_desc:0 "The Jadd has been established. But too many still don't contribute to the fight against the darkness. We shall convince them by word and by spear, and spread the truth to the rest of the world. The darkness shall be banished and Surael will be able to return."
 jaddari_reform_the_cult_title:0 "Reform the Cult"
 jaddari_reform_the_cult_desc:0 "We hold Bulwar, the heart of the Cult, and with that we hold their high priests.

 jaddari_expand_local_administration_desc:0 "Having studied the administration of the Harimraj, there are many lessons we can take away from them. One important factor is that we need efficient local administration, but one that is well integrated into the imperial machine. We cannot let the ministers get too powerful, or unwieldy. Instead we will have local governors directly answerable to the Divine-Herald."

A small tribe of Siadunan harpies captured a group of dying soldiers and saved them from death by dehydration. They nursed them back to life and an arrangement was made to exchange services. The harpies could breed and we had access to their food and water. This tribe would be one of the first to see the light of the Jadd through their contact with us."

 #Events
 jaddari_missions.1.t:0 "The Cult is Shaken"
 jaddari_missions.1.d:0 "The followers of the Jadd have seized the temple of Bulwar and with that the control of the high priests of the Cult. Under the influence of their Jaddari overlords the high priests have proclaimed that Sun Elves aren't the true successors of Surael, but that Jaddar was right and it is the duty of all those within the cult to do his duties. Some in our lands have found this convincing, but many look sceptically at this development. Now the decision is ours: How do we respond to this development?"
 jaddari_missions.1.a:0 "Ah! Capital!"
 jaddari_missions.1.b:0 "Just make sure they don't misbehave."
 jaddari_missions.1.c:0 "The heretics can rot!"
 jaddari_missions.2.t:0 "An Offer of Mutual Gain"
 jaddari_missions.2.d:0 "Our elven friends in Jaddari have approached us with an offer. Their ambassador has proposed a new arrangement between our nations. He talks of a grant of land, guaranteed self-rule and most importantly, freedom from the stigma of monsters that the world has seen us as. In return they ask for greater integration of our alliance. It is a good offer, but there are those who whisper that it's really just a way for them to subjugate us."
 jaddari_missions.2.a:0 "We will no longer be seen as monsters!"
 jaddari_missions.2.b:0 "Subjugation? Never!"
 jaddari_missions.3.t:0 "Elayenna Accepts Our Offer!"
 jaddari_missions.3.d:0 "Our envoys to Elayenna have returned. Their expressions speak of great success. They bring word of the matriarch of Elayenna that our offer as been accepted. Our two nations will now be even more closely tied and in the future this will lead both our people advancing the light of the Jadd even more effectively."
 jaddari_missions.3.a:0 "Splendid!"
 jaddari_missions.4.t:0 "Elayenna Refused Our Offer!"
 jaddari_missions.4.d:0 "Our envoys to Elayenna have returned. Their disheartened expressions show their failure. They bring word of the matriarch of Elayenna that our offer has been refused. They claim that this offer is an attack on their sovereignty and they are perfectly capable of convincing the world that they are no monsters themselves."
 jaddari_missions.4.a:0 "Very disappointing"
 jaddari_missions.5.t:0 "Preparations For The Expedition"
 jaddari_missions.5.d:0 "Ever since our glorious expedition into the darkness of the Serpentspine has been announced, it's all anyone has been able to talk about. Now it is also time for us to put something tangible behind our claims. To do such an expedition we need the proper men and equipment. The Dwarovar is dangerous and we won't be able to secure their safety as they head into the depths. Who should we even send? What will be our approach. The people are already starting to speculate."
 jaddari_missions.5.a:0 "This expedition will be led by our greatest warriors!"
 jaddari_missions.5.b:0 "Prepare a large and well funded expedition!"
 jaddari_missions.5.c:0 "Send a group of famous adventurers"
 jaddari_missions.6.t:0 "The Goal Of The Expedition"
 jaddari_missions.6.d:0 "We have gathered our expedition and prepared their equipment. Bards know their names and priests speak of the great deeds they'll do in the name of Surael. They shall banish the dark from the serpentspine. But the tunnels of the Dwarovar span miles uncountable, the caves are infinite and the holds reach unknown depths. Where should we send our expedition. What is their goal?"
 jaddari_missions.6.a:0 "The true enemy is hidden deep within the ancient holds."
 jaddari_missions.6.b:0 "We must banish the darkness from the caves."
 jaddari_missions.6.c:0 "Explore the Dwarovrod."
 jaddari_missions.7.t:0 "The Expedition has Disappeared"
 jaddari_missions.7.d:0 "It has been many seasons since our expedition marched into the depths of the Dwarovar. We have been waiting with bated breath for their return. But as weeks turned into months and months turned into years, life returned to normal. Now it might really be time to declare the expedition lost. Who knows what happened to them? Maybe they succumbed to a goblin ambush. Maybe they encountered some sort of monster that dwells within the depths of the earth. Maybe they just lost their way? May Surael protect their souls."
